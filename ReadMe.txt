Undead Stones by pistillphil

The Game:

You are a femal wizard apprentice. Suddenly you wake up in your masters dungeon, and there are skeletons everywhere!
No problem, you can do magic right? Yeah... You were only taught one spell so far: OBLITERATE.
Problem is you did not train that much so all it can do is: FREEZE.
So just try to avoid the evil Skeletons, hit them a few times to freeze them, but never touch them!
Frozen or not they WILL damage you!
Just try to survive as long as possible. As soon as your health is too low, an infinite number of skeletons will spawn and the game is considered to be over.

Controls:
WASD - Control the wizardess
Arrows- Shoot in 4 directions

The Source Code:
Yeah, the source code is a mess, depending on the work i have to do I may or may not clean it up a bit.
But hey, it's my first complete Slick2D game and it works :-)
